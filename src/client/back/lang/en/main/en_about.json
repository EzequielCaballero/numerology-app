            "answer": [
                "Numerology is a heterogeneous set of beliefs with its own methods, an esoteric science whose basis is the obtaining and interpretation of numerical values which are considered to have a \"vibratory\" meaning for the person.",
                "There are various schools/approaches associated with numerology, so the methods used to obtain a person's numbers and their subsequent interpretation vary.",
                "The application you are using takes the Pythagorean approach, which assumes that there is an order in all things and beings in the Universe and that we are governed or programmed by the vibration of numbers on a metaphysical level.",
                "Its predecessor, Pythagoras (569 - 475 BC), is considered the one who has provided the basis for a structured, methodical, and formal development of it."

            "question": "What is the purpose of numerology?",
            "answer": [
                "In our eternal search for answers and with countless truths still hidden, numerology is presented as one more way, not as a single source of truth, but to provide from its place a constructive vision of the person, of their talents, possibilities, challenges, and potential destiny.",
                "Numerology is not a cold account with linear results but requires simply observing the whole since an individual is in himself a whole, completeness.",
                "It is not a date, it is not a name, it is not a stage, it is not a tool, it is a soul, a mind, a body, it is its essence, its image, its relationship with the world, it is its birth home and the decisions made.",
                "In short, the person is a set of events, people, places, moments that went through it and above all it is a being that came to evolve, that is, to get out of mandates, behaviors, beliefs that initially diverted it from its path, or in any case, that gave it wrong directions to travel it.",
                "Keep in mind that numbers, like the stars, incline but do not determine. You are the architect of your life."

                "Tools such as the personal interview are necessary for a more detailed analysis since a person is unique and as such, we must attend to all his numerological constitutionality to make a complete and precise study of possibilities and thus give him accurate indications not covered by this application.",
